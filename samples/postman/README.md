## Requirements
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)
- Skyroom web service API key

## How to use
Clone or download the repository. Run Postman and from the main menu open `File > Import...`. In the opened dialog choose the `collection.json` file from the `samples/postman` directory. We've provided some sample requests under the `Skyroom Web Service` collection. Now you can start playing with them or create your own according to the documentation. Keep in mind that you need to set the API key as part of the URL for every request.
