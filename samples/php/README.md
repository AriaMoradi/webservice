## Requirements
- PHP 5.3 or newer
- Skyroom web service API key

## How to run
Clone or download the repository. Copy the files from `samples/php` to your web server root directory and navigate to the path via your web browser. Use your Skyroom API key to set the web service URL and then try provided actions. You may need to change some method params which are hard coded in the `index.php` file.
